Scarves
This mask is shaped as an elephant and is covered in beads. Those remarkable patterns resemble the pattern of a leopard’s body. Members of the elephant society used to wear them while dancing. Their goal was to achieve social harmony. The elephant and the leopard were a symbol and they were considered to be able to take a human form.

Shawls
A dim object less than 10 light years from Earth appears to be the closest brown dwarf yet found. The “star” is so cold that any residents on an orbiting planet would see a dark sun in their starry “daytime” sky.
