    This mask is shaped as an elephant and is covered in beads. Those remarkable patterns resemble the pattern of a leopard’s body. Members of the elephant society used to wear them while dancing. Their goal was to achieve social harmony. The elephant and the leopard were a symbol and they were considered to be able to take a human form.
